## üóÉÔ∏è Data Version Control (DVC)

To ensure reproducibility and compliance in a regulated industry like insurance, DVC is used to version-control datasets and pipeline artifacts.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install DVC:
   ```bash
   pip install dvc

Initialize DVC:
    dvc init

Add Local Remote Storage:
    mkdir -p ./dvc-storage
    dvc remote add -d localstorage ./dvc-storage

Track and Version Raw Dataset:
    dvc add data/raw/insurance_data.csv
    git add data/raw/insurance_data.csv.dvc .gitignore
    git commit -m "Track raw dataset with DVC"

Push Dataset to Local Remote:
